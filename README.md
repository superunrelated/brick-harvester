===============

Brick Harvester scrapes lego.com's Pick A Brick and parses the html to a usable json format.

If lego.com changes anything at all, this is broken. Use at your own risk.

Hey! If you work at LEGO, why don't you guys make a public API for the Pick a Brick section? That way I can just delete this whole thing and forget about it.
 
I know you people at LEGO care a lot about your ©'s, ™'s and ®'s. They are all yours, keep them.
